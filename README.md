# Webpack Boilerplate

The aim of this repo is to demonstrate the basic concepts behind [Webpack][1], decoupled from other libraries and ideas. At it's core, Webpack bundles modularized JavaScript. However, it also encourages the bundling, and modularizing, of any other assets necessary for a client or server based project.



### The Application

To make things a little less bland, the source compiles to a page displaying a ticking clock. Hopefully it's simple enough for easy disection, while still illustrating the basic concepts of a Webpack based project.



### Things to Learn

Introduces users to these concepts:

- Configuring a simple build process and dev server
- Bundling JavaScript and other assets (fonts and CSS)
- Transpiling JavaScript from ES6 to ES5 with [Babel][2]



### Set Up

Make sure `npm` and `node` are [installed][3].

Clone this repo and `cd` into it. 

`npm install` to retrieve all dependencies specified in the package.json file.

`npm run dev-server` to start a [webpack-dev-server][4].

`npm run deploy` to create a minified, "production-ready" version of the site.
